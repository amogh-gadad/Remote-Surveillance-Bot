## 🖼️ System Architecture

**Hardware Components:**
- Raspberry Pi (central controller)
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors (movement)
- Electromechanical Firing Motor
- USB Camera (video feed)
- Power Supply

**Software Stack:**
- **Python 3**
- **Flask Framework** (web interface & HTTP server)
- **OpenCV** (video capture & MJPEG streaming)
- **RPi.GPIO** (GPIO pin control)
- **Multithreading** (smooth parallel video streaming)

## 🛠️ Functional Workflow

1. The Raspberry Pi initializes all components.
2. The Flask web server hosts the control dashboard.
3. User sends commands:
   - Movement control
   - Firing trigger
   - Snapshot capture
4. Raspberry Pi processes the commands:
   - Sends GPIO signals to motors and firing mechanism
   - Streams live video feed
5. User receives real-time video and control feedback.
